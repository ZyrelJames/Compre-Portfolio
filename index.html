				<h2>About my portfolio</h2>
				<p>Hello there first of all this is my honest portfolio, I just want to say that, this portfolio is related to me and how to describe myself, first picture 
                    thats me the slow learner guy, sporty guy and a coffee lover guy so in this comprehensive portfolio it so very simple to make because sometimes I never 
                    do coding before but this time I did it for my self improvement and also to make my self proud that I can do it. So as you can see in my portfolio I just put some of my pictures 
                    that I love the most and also the pictures that describes me the most. Next is as you can see in my porfolio is there is a "banog costume" that I used to wear when we perform
                    in our barangay events so I love dancing anyways and in other pictures there is a Minecraft game so I love playing games too and specially there is a picture of me and my girlfriend
                    I put her in my portfolio because she is the reason why I am motivated to do my best in everything that I do she gives me strength and also she is my inspiration in life. And other
                    pictures is all of my classmates since 1st year until now that we are already in our 4th year, I'm so thankful to them because they teach me how to code and how to design. And last 
                    picture as you can see, that is my sister and were incomplete because my mother and father is in another family but they still supporting us no matter what and thats my portfolio all 
                    about because this is my honest portfolio thank you and God bless us all!
                </p>
